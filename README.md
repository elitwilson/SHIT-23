# SHIT-23

**S**uperior **H**igh-security **I**mpenetrability **T**echnology, modulus 23.

A totally bulletproof encryption system that absolutely no one will ever break into. Ever.
We're very confident about this.

## What This Actually Is

A learning project for understanding how symmetric encryption works — by building it badly on purpose.
The "23" is the key constraint: all cryptographic operations work in mod-23 arithmetic, which keeps the math
simple enough to follow and the keyspace small enough that... well. We're not thinking about that right now.

## Usage

```
shit encrypt   # Protect your secrets forever
shit decrypt   # Get them back (you have the key, obviously)
```

## Why

Because the best way to understand how encryption works is to build something that looks like encryption,
feels like encryption, and absolutely crumbles under the slightest scrutiny. The math is real.
The security is not.
